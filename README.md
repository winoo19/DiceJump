## Watch Out for the Diverse Array of Enemies!


As you progress through the game, a variety of enemies will spontaneously appear in different locations. Each enemy type boasts unique behaviors, requiring you to skillfully evade their attacks and projectiles. Below is a concise breakdown of each enemy type:

### 1. The Ripple Shooter
Once spawned, it remains stationary until you leap over it! However, caution is advised as it unleashes a circular barrage of 10 bullets at a specific rhythm...
### 2. The Vortex Shooter
Similar to the Ripple Shooter but with added complexity. This adversary launches a spiraling volley of bullets in dual directions at an incredibly rapid pace. Your aim is to dodge these bullets swiftly and eliminate it before it overwhelms you!
### 3. The Stealth Sniper 
Among the most cunning adversaries, this enemy possesses the intelligence to track your movements. It strikes unexpectedly, firing a swift projectile in your direction when you're least prepared!
### 4. The Pursuer 
Considered the most persistent adversary, this foe doesn't shoot but relentlessly chases you at a remarkable speed. Your best bet? Run! Moreover, it's not easily fooled; attempting to close in for an attack will prompt it to evade your advances!

Be mindful that the final two adversaries aren't to be underestimated; they're powered by a **simple yet highly effective AI**. Their cunning behavior adds an extra layer of challenge, making them formidable opponents you'll need to outsmart to emerge victorious.
